Calendar Application for Communication Tracking

As a company, we aim to maintain strong professional relationships by keeping accurate records of our interactions with other organizations. The objective of this assignment is to develop a React-based Calendar Application that enables us to efficiently track communication with companies, ensuring follow-ups are timely and consistent. This tool will provide a centralized platform to log past interactions, plan future communications, and manage the frequency of engagement based on predefined schedules.
The application will include:

•	An Admin Module for setting up companies and communication parameters.

•	A User Module for visualizing, managing, and performing communication tasks.

Admin Module

For Company Management

The Company Management module allows admins to efficiently manage company information, including adding, editing, and deleting records. Each company entry includes details such as name, location, LinkedIn profile, email addresses, phone numbers, comments, and a default communication periodicity (e.g., every 2 weeks). This system ensures streamlined communication scheduling and tracking while providing a user-friendly interface, data validation, and integration with the communication tracking system for timely updates and reminders.

For Communication Method Management

The Communication Method Management module enables admins to define and organize the communication methods available in the system. Each method includes a name (e.g., "Visit" or "LinkedIn Post"), a description, an order sequence to determine its priority, and a mandatory flag indicating if the method is required in the sequence. By default, the system provides a predefined order for communication methods: LinkedIn Post, LinkedIn Message, Email, Phone Call, and Other. This setup ensures a structured and consistent approach to managing communication workflows with flexibility for customization.

User Module

  Dashboard -grid-like view 

  The dashboard offers a structured grid view where each row represents a company and displays key communication details. Columns include the company name, a summary of the last five communications (with type and date, e.g., "LinkedIn Post - 5th September"), and the next scheduled communication (including type and date). This layout provides admins with a concise and comprehensive overview of recent and upcoming interactions for effective management and planning.
